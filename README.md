# Scylla
A minimalist client for the Matrix chat protocol.

## Why?
Riot, the flagship Matrix client, is slow. Switching rooms has a noticable delay (probably around several hundred milliseconds).
History loading causes strange jumps in the scroll position. Scylla aims to be faster and more responsive,
while still maintaining all the necessary features for a chat client. 

## What can it do?
Scylla currently supports the following features:
* Sending and receiving messages
* Sending and receiving images and files
* Converting Markdown into HTML for specially formatted messages
* Loading old history in a room

## Should I use Scylla?
Maybe. Scylla aims for a more minimalistic experience, remeniscent of IRC. It doesn't strive to have the rich chat client features
that Riot goes for, and attempts to polish the common tasks. If you would like a more advanced chat client, stick with Riot. However,
if you prefer polished minimalism, Scylla might be the client for you.
